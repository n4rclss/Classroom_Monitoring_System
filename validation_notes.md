# Merged Server Code Validation Notes

**Objective:** Merge `servers_sqlite_migrated` (SQLite login/session) and `servers` (in-memory rooms/messaging).

**Validation Steps Performed:**

1.  **Code Review:**
    *   `database/sqlite_db.py`: Successfully modified. Only `users` and `active_sessions` tables and related methods (`authenticate`, `get_role`, `add/remove/get_active_session`) remain. Room and chat history logic removed.
    *   `services/session_manager.py`: Successfully modified. Uses the injected `db` instance *only* for session management (`add/remove/get_active_session`). Manages rooms (`self.rooms`), connections (`self.connections`), and chat (`self.chat_history`) in memory. Methods adapted accordingly (`create_room_in_memory`, `join_room_in_memory`, `get_room_participants_in_memory`, `add_chat_message_in_memory`, `broadcast_message`, etc.).
    *   `protocols/protocol.py`: Successfully modified. `handle_login` uses `self.db.authenticate` and `self.session_mgr.register_user` (which interacts with DB and memory). All other handlers (`handle_create_room`, `handle_join_room`, `handle_refresh`, `handle_send_message_to_all`, `handle_chat_message`) now correctly call the in-memory methods of `self.session_mgr`. Role checks using `self.db.get_role` added where appropriate. `connectionLost` correctly calls `self.session_mgr.remove_connection` for cleanup.
    *   `main.py`: Correctly initializes the modified `ClassroomDatabase` and `SessionManager` and injects them into the `ClassProtocolFactory`.

2.  **Logical Check:**
    *   The separation of concerns seems correct: persistent user/session data in SQLite, volatile room/message data in memory.
    *   Dependency injection appears correct throughout the modified files.
    *   The flow for login uses the database, while subsequent room/message actions use the in-memory structures managed by the Session Manager.

**Conclusion:** Based on code review and logical analysis, the merged code appears to correctly implement the user's requirements. Login and session persistence rely on the SQLite database, while room management and messaging operate in memory. Live testing with a client is recommended for full verification but cannot be performed in this environment.
